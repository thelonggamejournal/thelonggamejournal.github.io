March Proverbs
<p>


Proverbs 
01:07 the wise follow the words of the Lord but the fools despise wisdom and instruction

01:08 your parents instructions are a gift (v commandment honor thy mother and thy father so you can life a long life)

01:10 avoid ill gotten gains, they and the methods you used to get them will destroy you.

01:20 the simple (gullible unwise) mock the wise, do not mock the wise - listen to them, or when your unwise actions have their consequences, the wise will not help you. 

01:27 the waywardness and simplicity of fools will eventually destroy them
